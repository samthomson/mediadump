picture management and CDN site


mediadump is designed to be an automated picture manager. for people or organisations that have too much media to keep track of effectively.

mediadump aims to automatically tag your files, and make them searchable.

instead of grouping your media into just folders, where files can get lost & forgotten about, mediadump can index them to keep them at your fingertips when you need to find the appropriate item.


images are processed by
- exif data
- geo exif data
- image object analysis (integration with imagga)
- geo places look up

planned
- geo elevation look up
